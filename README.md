# Rust Exercises
Let's see what the hype is about!
Exercises can be found in this [site](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).

(Yes, the guide only has exercises for the first 3 chapters...)

# How to run a program
No need write a whole cargo build system, just use `rustc`.
```
rustc name-of-program.rs
```

# How I can learn Rust more thoroughly?
You can still try and read the guides at https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/, or, if you're more of a hands-on learner like me, I suggest you try [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
